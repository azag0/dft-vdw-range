\section{Introduction}

In a true many-body electronic wave function, the motions of electrons are dynamically correlated, which can be seen in nontrivial shapes of electronic radial distribution functions.
KS-DFT replaces this complicated electronic motion with a simple uncorrelated motion of independent electrons, and mimics (in principle exactly) the effect of the correlation on the electronic energy with a one-electron local potential: the exchange--correlation (XC) potential.
In practice, however, approximate XC density functionals capture these correlation effects only partially, and standard approximations in particular fail to capture the effect of correlations between distant electrons: the long-range electron correlation.
This omission then leads to the well-known inability of standard density functionals to describe the noncovalent van der Waals (vdW) interactions.
