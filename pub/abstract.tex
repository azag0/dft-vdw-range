Correlation between electron fluctuations in matter, manifested in the exchange--correlation (XC) energy, is captured well by density functional theory (DFT) and semilocal XC functionals in the case of near electrons, but is left to van der Waals (vdW) dispersion models in the case of distant electrons.
Whereas the effective range of distances at which fluctuations are correlated is usually explicit in the vdW models, the complementary range of semilocal functionals can be observed only implicitly, requiring an introduction of empirical damping functions to couple the semilocal and nonlocal contributions to the XC energy.
We present a comprehensive study of the interplay between these short-range and long-range energy contributions in eight semilocal functionals (LDA, PBE, TPSS, SCAN, PBE0, B3LYP, SCAN0, M06-L) and three vdW models (MBD, D3, VV10) on noncovalently bonded organic dimers (S66), molecular crystals (X23), and supramolecular complexes (S12L), as well as on a series of graphene-flake dimers, covering a range of intermolecular distances (1.5--7\,\AA) and binding energies (0.5--130\,kcal/mol).
The profiles of many of the DFT+vdW combinations differ both quantitatively and qualitatively, and some of the qualitative differences are independent of the choice of the vdW model, establishing them as intrinsic properties of the respective semilocal functionals.
We find that while the SCAN+vdW methods give a narrow range of binding energy errors, the effective range of SCAN depends on system size, and we link this behavior to the specific dependence of SCAN on the electron localization function $\alpha$ around $\alpha=1$.
Our study provides a systematic procedure to evaluate the consistency of semilocal XC functionals when paired with nonlocal vdW models, and leads us to conclude that nonempirical generalized-gradient and hybrid functionals are currently among the most balanced semilocal choices for vdW systems.
